# Docker and Podman
On  today's session we will talk about containers using two most common technologies currently availible on the market. Note that those are not the only tools on the market, but this session is scheduled for 60 - 90 minutes, hence we will focus on the major players.
## What do I need to know before I start? 
To follow the labs you do not need any previous experience with containers. We will try to cover basic concepts at the beggining, but as usual we encourage to dig deeper and use the resources linked to the labs. If you are a tech enthusiast trying to make the first steps with the containers you are in the right place! If you are more advanced or maybe a Docker veteran trying to see what is this Podman kid all about, we will cover slightly more complexed aspects too so you should find something worth your time!

## Today's menu:
An overview of what we are going to cover. In each step we will try to note any differences in behaviour of Docker and Podman.
1. [Build and run](./lab_1/README.md) - We will build and run a simple container image and cover basic commands and fuctionality.
2. [Rootless and Rootfull](./lab_2/README.md) - We will run our containers in both modes.
3. [Pods](./lab_3/README.md) - Step to towards Kubernets

## Lab environment
For the duration of the [live stream](https://youtu.be/4kyubEhGnNY) (and a little longer so you can follow your rythym) we will provide lab environment.Note: We are DevOps engineers after all, hence instance distribution is automated, to get yours, you need to be registered on meetup either for [London](https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsPlayground/events/280836280/) or [Edinburgh](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Playground-Edinburgh/events/280836288/). Our support team will try to help you with any issues along the way so feel free to ask questions in the comments or on our community slack ([join](https://join.slack.com/t/playgroundsupport/shared_invite/zt-eovp57xv-cufxkw~jKycbA_bvJ~~Zxw))

If you came across this repo a little to late, you will need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) yourself.
